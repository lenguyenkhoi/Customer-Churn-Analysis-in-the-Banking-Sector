# 📊 Bank Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI + Python)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn in the banking sector by combining **Python for data preprocessing** and **Power BI for visualization**. The goal is to uncover key factors influencing churn—such as **Credit Score, Age, Balance, and Geography**—and provide actionable strategies to improve customer retention.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Identify key drivers of customer churn
* Analyze behavioral and demographic patterns
* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard
* Propose data-driven retention strategies

---

## 📂 Dataset

* **Source:** Bank Customer Churn Dataset (CSV)
* **Key Features:**

  * CustomerId
  * Geography
  * Gender
  * Age
  * Tenure
  * Balance
  * NumOfProducts
  * CreditScore
  * Exited (Churn Indicator)

## 🧹 Data Preparation (Python)

Data preprocessing was performed using Python before importing into Power BI.

### Steps:

* **Import Data**

  * Loaded CSV using `pandas`

* **Data Cleaning**

  * Handled missing values
  * Removed duplicate records based on `CustomerId`
  * Treated outliers in:

    * `Age`
    * `Balance`

* **Feature Engineering**

  * Created new features:

    * **Age Group** (Young, Middle-aged, Senior)
    * **Balance Category**

      * Low: < 50,000
      * Medium: 50,000 – 100,000
      * High: > 100,000

* **Data Export**

  * Saved cleaned dataset to a new CSV file for Power BI usage
